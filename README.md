# Invision Community Single Logout
Just a starter template for basic WordPress plugins. Please create a new repo from this template and make the relevant edits to This plugin logs a user out from Invision Community when they visit a specified URL, and then logs them out of WordPress. Helpful when using WordPress as an Oauth Server since Invision Community does not allow for a custom logout URL
